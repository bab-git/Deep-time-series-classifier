# Deep time series classifeir

This a part of the project which was about classificaiton of biomedical sensory data with a deep learning based architecture.

The significant part of the design is the light structure of the network as well as an efficient preprocesing step for the inputs which allow us to obtain satisfactory performance even by using a simple 3-4 layers CNN mdodels.
